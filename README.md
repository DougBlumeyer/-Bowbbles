# Rainbowbbles

Rainbowbbles is a simple to play and entrancing activity.

<b>Audio</b>
- The pitch of popping a 'bowbble correlates with its size
- The popping pitches are quantized to the same musical mode as the background music uses, allowing the player to essentially play the 'bowbbles as a musical instrument

<b>Visual & Physics</b>
- 'Bowbbles pop into three smaller 'bowbbles, one for each of the RGB color components
- These new smaller 'bowbbles are proportional both in size and color to the amount of their color in the popped 'bowbble
- When 'bowbbles collide (ones center crosses another's edge) they merge into a new 'bowbble with merged size, and weighted average color concentration & velocity vector
- This system thereby preserves both its spectrum and its energy

<b>Philosophy</b>
- Rainbowbbles spontaneously materialize with random color, position, and velocity, within a circle inscribed in the square window
- The bounds of these randomnesses are precisely set so that the spatially unbound system (no edge-wrapping) nonetheless trends toward the formation of a single central giant off-white 'bowbble
- Thus, one can choose either to pop 'bowbbles obsessively, or sit back and let them take their natural course (or alternate between approaches, or explore possibilities between them)
